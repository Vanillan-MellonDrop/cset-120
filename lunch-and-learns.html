    CSET-120:<br>
    Lunch &amp; Learn Requirements
  </h1>

  <p>
    This is a time for you to geek out over something you love and share it with the rest of us. The only requirement is that it is tech related. There are some example presentations at the bottom.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose is to get you comfortable sharing ideas with groups of your peers. In the real world, you'll be in meetings all the time. You might have to meet with clients and determine what the requirements for their project is. You might be working with a group and have to convince them the best way to solve the issue. You will often need to describe complex technical concepts to people who have no idea what you do.
  </p>

  <p>
    So the goal is to get us all to understand the thing you want to talk about.

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Talks must be 10-15 minutes long, not including time for questions afterward.</li>
    <li>You should have some sort of presentation to accompany your talk. Don't just read from the slides! Use them to help us understand your topic or to keep us interested.</li>
    <li>If you show a video, that doesn't count for your talk's length. This is for *you* to tell us about a thing, not for someone else to tell us about it.</li>
    <li>Give us some ways to keep learning about your topic, like links to articles, books, or videos to explore further.</li>
    <li>Have fun with it and get excited about your topic. How can we get excited for it if you aren't excited for it?</li>
  </ul>
